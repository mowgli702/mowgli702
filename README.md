Hey, I'm James H. Jackson Jr. I've always been drawn to the world of technology and creativity. I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast, and I love to design websites. Playing with HTML and making the web look awesome has been a passion of mine since high school.

But there's more to me than just being a computer geek. I've got a big heart for animals. I've spent time working in animal hospitals, helping out with surgeries, X-rays, and taking care of our furry friends. Making sure they're happy and healthy is important to me.

When I'm not behind a computer or at the animal hospital, you can find me planning events and building connections in my community. I've co-owned committees, organized successful events, and learned a lot about bringing people together.

Basketball is another one of my loves. I've been a part of AAU basketball for four years and played on my high school basketball teams. It's not just a sport for me; it's a way to stay active and connect with others.

So, I guess you could say I'm a tech-savvy, animal-loving, community-building, basketball-playing kind of guy. If you ever need someone to make your website pop, care for your pets, organize an event, or shoot some hoops, I'm your guy!"
